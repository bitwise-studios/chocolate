On the street corner, a familiar voice greets you:

&quot;Yo! Ugh, you ready for the stupid test today?&quot;, James says as he and Mark walks up beside you.

&quot;I&#x27;m sure ready!&quot;, Mark pipes up.

&quot;You sound like you actually like that test. I swear, skateboarding sounds more fun than some stupid term end test anyday&quot;, James replied.

&quot;The test is important! If I&#x27;m unable to acquire a satisfactory score, I won&#x27;t be admitted to the accelerated high school program!&quot; Mark has tried to use less big words since he started hanging out with us, but when he&#x27;s excited the fancy vocab slips out again.

&quot;Tell you what,&quot; James announced, &quot;I ain&#x27;t going to be stuck in that stupid room writing that test. I&#x27;m going skateboarding. You comin&#x27;?&quot;

Mark stared at you. You guessed that Mark really wants to follow James - he&#x27;s the coolest kid in the grade; everyone wants to be like him - but really wants to do well on that test too. He&#x27;s probably going to do what you do.

Do you want to [[follow James and skip school|skipschool]] or [[go to school and face that test|gotoschool]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="skipschool" tags="" position="358,588">&quot;Let&#x27;s roll, James&quot;, you replied. James pulls out his skateboard, jumps on it, motions you to catch up, and speeds away.

Mark takes a hesitating look to the school, then turns around and runs after James. You do likewise.

&quot;Here we go. Sweetest obstacle course I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; James announced.

You three are on the edge of the woods north of No. 1 Street - a fence with a &quot;Do not trespass&quot; sign and a rather large hole is behind you.

&quot;Last one to the lake solves algebra for fun!&quot;, James shouted as he started to jump on his board again.

Mark mumbled, &quot;but I do enjoy algebra...&quot;

Just then, you hear sirens behind you. Police! Suddenly the &quot;No trespass&quot; sign seems to have grown bigger.

Mark whispered, &quot;oh we&#x27;re in so much trouble what if our parents discover our absenteeism&quot;

James shouts, &quot;Run for it!&quot;, and gives a big push on his board. You and Mark scrambles to [[follow him on foot|skipschool2]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="gotoschool" tags="" position="508,588">I ignored James and continued to head towards school. Seeing my choice, Mark followed along. James stood there, and after we&#x27;d walked a block ahead he finally shouted, &quot;wait for me, I&#x27;m coming!&quot;

Hmm. Peer pressure does work, after all.

Mr. Freeman, our teacher, was a nice guy. Even James once admitted that he thought our teacher was &quot;ok&quot;, which is strange coming from a guy who hates school.

Mr. Freeman started the class not with the dreaded test, but with a comprehensive review session. By the end of it, I was feeling... can it be? - confident.

&quot;And one more piece of advice: if you don&#x27;t know what the answer is, just guess! After all, as I&#x27;ve always said in science class; don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment!&quot;, Mr. Freeman announced as he handed out the tests.

Well, this is it, then. [[the test of doom|easytest]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="skipschool2" tags="" position="358,738">All three of you scramble to get away from the edge of the forest before the police finds you trespassing. You run faster than Mark (like everyone else in your grade), but way slower than James, even without his skateboard (Despite his boasts during recess he can&#x27;t actually skate the twisty dirt paths in the woods). You spent so much effort trying to catch up with James in your panicked run, but you finally met up with him on the shore of the small lake.

&quot;Phew. That was close. My mom would&#x27;ve killed me if they catch me again. Say, where&#x27;s slowpoke Mark? Ugh. we&#x27;ll wait for him; hopefully the police hasn&#x27;t got him yet.&quot;

After waiting for ten minutes, there&#x27;s still no sign of Mark. We retraced our steps and found Mark whimpering beside a tree stump.

&quot;AAAowwww my leg!! There&#x27;s so much hemorrhaging!!&quot;

&quot;You... broke your leg? Is that where the blood is coming from?&quot;

&quot;YeessAaaowww! I don&#x27;t want to die in the forest!&quot;

James mumbled, &quot;If my mom finds out about this, I&#x27;m dead.&quot; Then he took off at a run again.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; you yell after him, but he didn&#x27;t respond. You can guess though - he&#x27;s running back to school; he&#x27;ll get in less trouble for that than for getting Mark in this bind.

By now you&#x27;re pretty scared - the adrenaline from the run has worn off; you can hear sirens - so the police is still looking for trespassers; you wonder if you should [[follow James back to school, leaving Mark behind|followjamesback]] or [[stay and help Mark|stayandhelpmark]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="followjamesback" tags="" position="358,887">As you near the school, you wonder if you should tell the school nurse about what happened to Mark. But before you can think of a good enough lie Mr. Freeman sights you, and shouts, &quot;What are you two waiting there for? The test&#x27;s about to start! You already missed the whole review session!&quot;

Oh well, might as well [[finish the test|hardtest]]. Mark&#x27;ll be alright.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="stayandhelpmark" tags="" position="508,888">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Mark!&quot;, you shout, but you know that you can&#x27;t do first aid. What to do?

&quot;I see you kiddos been trespassing here&quot;, chimed a voice behind us. A police officer showed up. &quot;and looks like your friend here already paid the price for it. Take the one with the broken leg to hospital, and take the other back to school.&quot;

This is it, then. Caught by the police. At least they&#x27;re not punishing us; they&#x27;re just taking Mark to hospital and [[taking me back to school]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="taking me back to school" tags="" position="508,1038">The police officer stops at the school, and pulled me to the front desk of the school, where he explained that Mark and I had been caught skipping school and that Mark&#x27;s been injured.

[[Head back to the living room|scene5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="your office" tags="" position="236,1927">The best doctor in the country deserves the best office. A well-stocked operating room with the latest equipment can be seen through frosted glass in the consultation and waiting area. Usually the area is full of patients - after all, everyone wants to be cured by the miracle surgeon, even top polititians and movie stars - but they all had to wait in line here. Today, the area is empty because your patients booked the entire place for themselves for privacy. You can&#x27;t remember the last patients who were able to afford that.

The door opens and a young couple walk through the door, the young man being steadied by his wife.

&quot;Mark! Long time no see! Come and have a seat and we&#x27;ll discuss your options.&quot;

As every gossip magazine is quick to point out, Mark, your old friend and the genius who had designed a social network in high school that made him a billionare by age 23, had been stricken with a neurodegenerative disease at 25. You can just detect a hint of a tremor as he sat down slowly besides his wife on a bench in the waiting area.

&quot;I&#x27;ve looked at the treatment options: the current state of the art options only slows down the progression of the disease. Even I cannot cure the disease entirely.&quot;

&quot;But we&#x27;ve been doing our research, and we know that there is research done with plaque levels in the brain; they suggests an operation to enhance circulation might be a cure!&quot; Mark&#x27;s wife argued.

&quot;That option&#x27;s too risky: operating on the brain&#x27;s blood vessels can easily lead to a stroke, and twenty out of the thirty experimental subjects on that study died on the operating table. I cannot risk my reputation on a dangerous experiment.&quot; you responded.

&quot;P-please, h-help me, bu-ddy.&quot; Mark spoke for the first time, trembling slightly with each word. You&#x27;ve never expected Mark&#x27;s condition to have advanced by this much.

You remember that test you took with Mark, years ago - you were unprepared, took a chance, and did well anyways. Perhaps you should try [[conducting the operation]] with the same attitude.
Then again, there&#x27;s no review session to save you this time.
